  content: `<h2>Understanding Israel Tourist Visa Requirements</h2>
<p>Applying for an Israel tourist visa requires careful preparation and submission of all necessary documents. This comprehensive checklist will guide you through every document you need to submit for a successful visa application. Missing even a single document can lead to delays or rejection, so it's crucial to have everything in order before you apply.</p>

<p>The Israeli Embassy in India has specific requirements for tourist visa applications, and meeting all these requirements significantly increases your chances of approval. This guide breaks down each document category and explains exactly what you need to provide.</p>

<h2>Essential Documents Checklist</h2>

<h3>1. Valid Passport</h3>
<p>Your passport is the most critical document for your visa application. It must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Validity:</strong> Must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay in Israel</li>
  <li><strong>Blank Pages:</strong> At least 2 blank visa pages (facing pages preferred)</li>
  <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Passport should be in good condition, not torn or damaged</li>
  <li><strong>Previous Visas:</strong> If you have an old passport with previous visas, submit that as well</li>
  <li><strong>Signature:</strong> Passport must be signed by the holder</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If your passport expires within 6 months, apply for a new passport before starting your visa application. The Israeli authorities are strict about this requirement.</p>

<h3>2. Visa Application Form</h3>
<p>The completed visa application form is mandatory. Here's what you need to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the form from the official Israeli Embassy website</li>
  <li>Fill it out completely in English using CAPITAL letters</li>
  <li>Ensure all information matches your passport exactly</li>
  <li>Sign and date the form personally</li>
  <li>Do not leave any fields blank - write "N/A" if not applicable</li>
  <li>Print on A4 size paper</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Passport-Size Photographs</h3>
<p>Photograph specifications for Israel visa application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Size:</strong> 5cm x 5cm (2 inches x 2 inches)</li>
  <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> 2 recent photographs</li>
  <li><strong>Background:</strong> White or light-colored background</li>
  <li><strong>Face Coverage:</strong> Face should cover 70-80% of the photograph</li>
  <li><strong>Expression:</strong> Neutral expression, mouth closed</li>
  <li><strong>Recency:</strong> Taken within the last 6 months</li>
